# Movie Database App

This is my capstone project for the ALX Front-End course.  
I just started building it and so far, I’ve only set up the basic structure using React and Tailwind CSS.

The goal of the project is to create a simple movie database web app where users can search for movies and see details like the title, year, and poster using the OMDB API.



## My Current Progress
So far, I have:
- Initialized the project with Vite  
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS
- Cleaned up the default Vite setup  
- Added a Search Bar component (just the input and button for now)

The app can display the search bar but doesn’t fetch any data yet. I’m still working on connecting it to the API.


## My Next Steps
- Connect the SearchBar to the OMDB API  
- Display a list of movies from the search results  
- Add a movie details page  
- Improve the UI with Tailwind styling


## Known Issues
- The search bar doesn’t fetch any movie yet (still in progress)  
- Styling is basic and not responsive yet  
- No movie results are being displayed yet
