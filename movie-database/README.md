# Movie Database App
## THE BEGINNING 
This is my capstone project for the ALX Front-End course.  
I just started building it and so far, I’ve only set up the basic structure using React and Tailwind CSS.

The goal of the project is to create a simple movie database web app where users can search for movies and see details like the title, year, and poster using the OMDB API.

## My Current Progress
So far, I have:
- Initialized the project with Vite  
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS
- Cleaned up the default Vite setup  
- Added a Search Bar component (just the input and button for now)

The app can display the search bar but doesn’t fetch any data yet. I’m still working on connecting it to the API.


## My Next Steps
- Connect the SearchBar to the OMDB API  
- Display a list of movies from the search results  
- Add a movie details page  
- Improve the UI with Tailwind styling


## Known Issues
- The search bar doesn’t fetch any movie yet (still in progress)  
- Styling is basic and not responsive yet  
- No movie results are being displayed yet

## THE END
This is the end of my Capstone Project for the ALX Frontend Web Development Program.
It is a simple movie search website built using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and the OMDB API.

The goal of this project was to bring together what I’ve learned so far in the course of the program.

## Project Overview

My Movie Database App allows users to:

Search for any movie by name
View movie posters, titles, and release years
Click on a movie card to view detailed information like plot, genre, actors, and ratings
Navigate back to the search results easily

It’s a simple project that focuses on understanding React fundamentals, API integration, and styling with Tailwind.

## How It Works
My user types a movie title into the search bar
The app sends a request to the OMDB API
The results are displayed with each movie’s poster, title, and year
Clicking a movie opens its details (plot, genre, actors, and rating)
Back button returns the user to the movie list
Users can also add movies to favourites

## Known Issues

My layout could still be improved for smaller screens
I battled with my Movie list showing in a vertical layout and not horizontal as planned

## Future Improvements
I would like to include movie trailers
To Add a dark/light theme switch
